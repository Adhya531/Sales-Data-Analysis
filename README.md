**Superstore Sales Analysis**

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a hypothetical Superstore using Power BI. The goal is to gain insights into sales trends, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and uncover opportunities for business growth.

**Data Sources:**

* Excel sheet given in Repository

**Data Preparation:**

* Imported the sales data into Power BI.
* Cleaned and transformed the data, including:
    * Standardizing data formats.
    * Creating calculated columns and measures (AvgDelivery).

**Dashboard Design:**

The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance:

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** 
    * Total Sales
    * Total Profit
    * Total Orders
    * Average Order Value
    * Customer Count
* **Sales by Region:** A map visualization highlighting sales performance across different regions (Central, East, South, West).
* **Sales by Category:** Bar charts showing sales distribution across product categories.
* **Sales by Subcategory:** Bar charts providing a deeper dive into sales performance within each category.
* **Sales by Segment:** Pie charts illustrating sales distribution across customer segments (e.g., Home Office, Corporate, Consumer).
* **Sales by Ship Mode:** Bar charts analyzing sales performance by shipping method.
* **Sales Trend Analysis:** Line charts visualizing sales and profit trends over time.
* **Year-over-Year (YOY) Analysis:** Charts comparing sales and profit figures year-over-year to identify growth trends.
* **Sales by Payment Mode:** Charts analyzing sales distribution based on payment methods.

**Key Insights:**

* **Regional Performance:**
    * **Central & East:** These regions demonstrated the strongest sales performance, contributing significantly to overall revenue and profit.
    * **West & South:** These regions exhibited lower sales volumes, profits, and order quantities compared to Central and East.
* **Product Performance:**
    * Category-level analysis revealed variations across regions. Some categories performed well in specific regions while others lagged.
    * Further analysis within each category is required to identify best-selling and underperforming subcategories.
* **Customer Segmentation:** 
    * Customer behavior and preferences differed across regions and segments.
* **Shipping Performance:**
    * Delivery times were generally consistent across regions, with the South region showing the lowest average delivery days. 
    * Analysis of shipping modes revealed potential for optimization in terms of cost and delivery speed.
* **Year-over-Year (YOY) Trends:** 
    * Sales and profit growth varied across regions. Some regions showed consistent growth, while others experienced fluctuations.

**Recommendations:**

* **Regional Focus:**
    * **Central & East:** Maintain and enhance market share in these regions through targeted marketing campaigns and product mix optimization.
    * **West & South:** Implement strategies to increase market penetration, such as targeted marketing campaigns, product introductions, and improved customer service.
* **Product Strategy:**
    * Conduct in-depth analysis of category and subcategory performance in each region to optimize product mix and inventory levels.
    * Identify and introduce new products that cater to specific regional demands.

* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** 
    * Continuously analyze sales data to identify trends, anticipate future demand, and make informed business decisions.

**Tools Used:**

* Power BI

**Project Outcome:**
